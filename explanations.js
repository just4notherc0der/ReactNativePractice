STYLING
-------

First, it important to know that all of the core components in React Native can accept a prop named style. One way we can leverage this prop is to provide styling to components with inline JavaScript objects:

function Avatar ({ src }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Image
        style={{borderRadius: 5, margin: 10, width: 48, height: 48}}
        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

In the example above, the <Image> component receives two props: style and source. The value of style is just a plain old JavaScript object with borderRadius, margin, width, and height properties. Keep in mind that unlike CSS on the web, properties are written in camelCase (i.e., borderRadius in CSS in JS, but border-radius on the web).

This works, but things can get muddy quickly. Imagine if the inline object contained a dozen properties, or if we wanted the same style to apply to more than just one component! One way to keep your code DRY and reusable is to store the object in a variable:

const styles = {
  image: {
    borderRadius: 5,
    margin: 10,
    width: 48,
    height: 48
  }
};

function Avatar ({ src }) {
  return (
    <View>
      <Image
        style={styles.image}
        source={{uri: 'https://tylermcginnis.com/tylermcginnis_glasses-300.png'}}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
It's a great way to clean things up a bit, but React Native goes a step further with its StyleSheet API. Check out the following example:

import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class TextExample extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text style={styles.greenLarge}>This is large green text!</Text>
        <Text style={styles.red}>This is smaller red text!</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  greenLarge: {
    color: 'green',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: 40
  },
  red: {
    color: 'red',
    padding: 30
  },
});
Here, an object containing styles is passed into StyleSheet's create method. It looks similar to styling with a JavaScript object variable! But as we mentioned above, using StyleSheet gives us a few benefits in terms of code quality and performance. Weâ€™ll take a closer look later in this Lesson as well, but this is how the React Native docs describe it:

Code quality

By moving styles away from the render function, you're making the code easier to understand.
Naming the styles is a good way to add meaning to the low-level components in the render function.
Performance

Making a stylesheet from a style object makes it possible to refer to it by ID instead of creating a new style object every time.
It also allows to send the style only once through the bridge. All subsequent uses are going to refer an id (not implemented yet).
Another benefit is that StyleSheet validates the content within the style object as well. This means that should there be any errors in any properties or values in your style objects, the console will throw an error during compilation instead of at runtime.

If you wanted to implement more than one style to a component, the style prop can accept styles as an array:

<Text style={[styles.red, styles.greenLarge]}>This will be red, then greenLarge</Text>

Styling in React is going through a renaissance period right now just as Flux did a few years ago (which eventually gave us Redux). There are many different styling libraries popping up and each has different tradeoffs. Two of the most popular are Glamorous and Styled Components. The whole idea of both of these libraries is that styling is a primary concern of the component and because of that, should be coupled with the component itself. We'll take a look at using Styled Component with React Native a little bit later.
